## PageRank Algorithm Information:

Page Rank Algorithm is also known as Google algorithm which was introduced by Lary Page, who was the founder of Google. It was first employed in the Google 
search engine to rank web pages. It is increasingly being employed in a variety of industries these days, such as ranking individuals on social media. The PageRank 
algorithm demonstrates how to start with a difficult problem and work your way down to a simple solution. The PageRank computations necessitate numerous trips through
the collection, referred known as "iterations," in order to update approximation PageRank values to more nearly represent the theoretical actual value. PageRank can be determined for any large collection of 
documents.
