# Description                         

Project on Big Data to develop Google Page Rank using Apache Spark with Java.

## Apache Spark



##  Page rank:

Page Rank Algorithm is also known as Google algorithm which was introduced by Lary Page, who was the founder of Google. It was first employed in the Google search engine to rank web pages. It is increasingly being employed in a variety of industries these days, such as ranking individuals on social media. The PageRank algorithm demonstrates how to start with a difficult problem and work your way down to a simple solution. The PageRank computations necessitate numerous trips through the collection, referred known as "iterations," in order to update approximation PageRank values to more nearly represent the theoretical actual value. PageRank can be determined for any large collection of documents.

## Algorithm Explanation:

PageRank is determined by the quantity and quality of backlinks and is based on authoritative criteria. That is, the higher a page's PageRank ranking is, the more and better links it has on other sites. However, there are now a slew of other elements that go into determining a website's rating. The greater the PageRank, the more trustworthy a website is in theory. For a long time, the White House website in the United States was a site with the highest trust and a PR of 10. Cities', universities', and research institutions' websites, as well as philanthropic organizations', have a high PageRank.
