# Description                         

Our Big-Data Project is demonstrating the calculation of a website using page rank algorithm in java with Apache Spark runner. 

## Apache Spark



##  Page rank:

Page Rank Algorithm is also known as Google algorithm which was introduced by Lary Page, who was the founder of Google. It was first employed in the Google search engine to rank web pages. It is increasingly being employed in a variety of industries these days, such as ranking individuals on social media.

## Algorithm Explanation:

PageRank is determined by the quantity and quality of backlinks and is based on authoritative criteria. That is, the higher a page's PageRank ranking is, the more and better links it has on other sites.The greater the PageRank, the more trustworthy a website is in theory. For a long time, the White House website in the United States was a site with the highest trust and a PR of 10.
